Sample React+Flux application

from the "Sample app from 'Building Applications with React and Flux' Pluralsight course."

The course requires Node 0.12.6.

If you install Node using the official packager, there's no official way to uninstall.  You're left to manually delete the files.  Personally, I don't like that kind of uninstall.

You might have better luck using nvm.  Or if you can find it, a brew receipe (I couldn't find one in February 2018).
